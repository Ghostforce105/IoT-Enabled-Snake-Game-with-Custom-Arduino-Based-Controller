# IoT-Enabled Snake Game with Custom Arduino-Based Controller

## Project Description
This project implements the classic **Snake Game** in Python, enhanced with custom hardware integration using **Arduino UNO** to create a unique physical game controller. The system combines software-based game logic with IoT-driven input control, providing an engaging and interactive user experience.

The Snake Game is developed using **Python** (with `tkinter`) for rendering, movement logic, and scoring. Instead of using a traditional keyboard, a custom **IoT controller** is designed using Arduino UNO, programmed through the Arduino IDE. The controller features physical buttons (or a joystick) to control the snake’s movement and communicates with the Python game via **serial communication (USB)**.

This project demonstrates **IoT integration in gaming**, highlighting the synergy between hardware and software for real-time interactivity.

## Software Components
- **Python** (with `tkinter`) for Snake Game
- **Arduino IDE** for microcontroller programming
- **PySerial** library for serial communication

## Working Principle
1. **Controller Input**: Buttons on the Arduino controller are pressed.
2. **Data Transmission**: Arduino sends corresponding commands (e.g., `UP`, `DOWN`) via serial to the PC.
3. **Game Response**: Python game reads serial input and updates the snake’s direction in real time.
